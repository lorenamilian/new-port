      My name is Christian although I was born and raised here in Orlando,FL. I'm 19yrs old and happy that I got to officially graduate Hs 2019. What brought me to Career Source Coding Skool was to actually try something new and actually see If I would like it. I really do wanna be a Gaming Programmer overall which I'm glad I took this next step to Code.even tho I did struggle at some point, but chose to not give up. I would like to thank my Instructor Mr. Rogers for taking the time to teach me and my fellow Classmates to be a Developer.</h2>
